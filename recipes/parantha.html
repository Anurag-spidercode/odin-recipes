        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Paratha is a flaky, golden-brown Indian flatbread made by layering and cooking dough on a griddle.<br>
            Soft inside yet slightly crisp outside, it can be enjoyed plain or stuffed with spiced fillings like potatoes,<br>
            paneer, or vegetables. Traditionally cooked with ghee or oil, parathas are a staple of North Indian breakfasts <br>
            and are often served hot with yogurt, pickles, or curries.
